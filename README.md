Hi, Welcome to my Grad repository.

In this repository I will be sharing projects that I've done in my undergraduate study. I will not just be posting any exercise that I do, but I'll share projects that had some higher degree of difficulty, and some of them may imitate real-life solutions.

Be free to give me feedback whenever you can.

Thank you!
